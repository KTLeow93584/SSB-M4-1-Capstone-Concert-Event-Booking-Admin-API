## Pre-requisites
Navigating through this project requires you to at least have a fundamental level of understanding of the following:

1. [CSS/Tailwind Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/)
2. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
3. [Embedded JavaScript Templates - Used in Mail Templates](https://ejs.co/)
4. [Google Firebase Setup - Social Platform Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
5. [REST APIs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/) and hosting (IP Addresses, ports, etc.).
6. [How environment variables/secrets work](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode)
7. [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)
8. [Mailgun Integration](https://www.mailgun.com/)
9. [Telesign Integration](https://www.telesign.com/)

## Features
1. **Authentication** (Admins/Staff Only - WIP)
Registration and Login via Email/Password, Google, Facebook.

2. **Mobile Phone Number** Verification (Integration-side)
SMS OTP before registration form is submitted to back-end to verify phone validity. Most of the inner workings are from the back-end server. Using Telesign third party service, free account has a limited amount of verifications before the free credits expire. Once expired, back-end server will only ensure that no duplicate numbers will be permitted and SMS code prompts will be disabled from then on.

3. **CRUD Functionalities** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Schedule, manage and coordinate event bookings with the team! The front-end side mainly deals with consumers, in this case, the prospective clients (Music Company Agents, Band Agents, etc.) desiring to make their future band tour in a certain country a reality.

4. **Records Tracking/CRUD** (WIP)
Admins/Staffs can have a bird's eye view on all the existing event bookings, as well as power to approve/reject and make adjustments to the bookings.
